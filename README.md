# Image-Recognition-using-SVM-Classifier
Automatic class detection of images based on pre-classified images
Approach:
- Extract features for a large, pre-labelled image dataset. The feature extracted was color histogram
- Train binary (One against rest) Support Vector Machine classifier over dataset.
- Predict classes(labels) for non-pre-labelled image datasets.
